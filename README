unix-socket-client

I was messing around with memcached, which has an option to run a local
daemon using a unix socket rather than binding to a tcp port, and was
looking for a program that could interact with it like telnet could with
internet hosts, but couldn't find any, other than a non-standard patch
to netcat, which wasn't installed on the needed machine, so I created
this.

The client works by sending stdin to the socket and printing data read
from the socket to stdout.

A simple server is provided for testing. It will run a given command for
each connected peer. It is only capable of handling one peer at a time.

Install by running make. Copy the executables whereever (into your $PATH
for instance).
